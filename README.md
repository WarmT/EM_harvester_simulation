# EM_harvester_simulation

This project contains Python scripts for simulating electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters. More specifically a harvester 
that that have a moving magnet as a proof mass that levitates between end magnets inside a tube. Nonlinear magnetic springs are 
calculated using FEM and the results are compared with the measurements...

All scripts are written for Python 2.7 and they use several packages from SciPy. Easiest way to run these is to install Anaconda 
Python distribution from Continuum Analytics ( http://continuum.io/ ).
